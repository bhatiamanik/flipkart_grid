AI-Powered Size Chart Generator for Apparel Sellers - Software Development Track

Executive Summary
 Problem statement:
User-Centric Analysis: Employs advanced algorithms to integrate and process user body metrics (height, weight, chest, waist, hip, etc.) for precision in size recommendation.
Seller Customization: Offers a customizable AI framework for apparel sellers, aligning size charts with specific sizing standards using scalable algorithms.
Dynamic Size Chart Generation: Generates AI-powered, adaptive size charts with probabilistic confidence scores for different apparel sizes.

 Proposed Solution:
Convert the cleaned dataset into Gaussian curves to accurately model the distribution of body measurements.
Train the AI model using cross-validation techniques to avoid overfitting and ensure generalizability across diverse datasets.
 A hybrid AI model architecture using TensorFlow, combining supervised learning for size classification to group similar body types.
Generate a confusion matrix to evaluate model performance, specifically focusing on precision, recall, and F1-score for each size category.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6bfd4bf-add1-4152-99bb-b222d4f5eed7)
